# ed-karma

Ed Karma is a browser extension that allows teachers using the Ed forum to score student contributions.

## What does Ed Karma do?

Ed Karma adds a menu to each forum contribution. This allows teachers to award points to contributions based on their helpfulness.

Ed Karma also provides an analytics page to summarise the contributions made and points earned by each student.

By default, scores are stored in the user's browser. But as this does not allow teachers to share scores, Ed Karma provides the option to store scores on a server. Instructions for setting up the server can be found on the `api` page.
